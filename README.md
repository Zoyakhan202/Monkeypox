# In Silico-Based Drug Discovery Targeting Monkeypox Virulence

Project Overview
This project explores in silico drug discovery methodologies to identify potential therapeutic agents for combating Monkeypox virus (MPXV). Leveraging computational tools, the study focuses on the interaction between Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4), a key player in innate immunity, and Resiquimod, a synthetic immune modulator. This research aims to provide insights into enhancing immune responses to Monkeypox through targeted therapies.

Objectives
Protein Target: TLR4 (PDB ID: 4G8A), critical for immune response.
Ligand Selection: Resiquimod, a TLR4 agonist known for immune modulation.
Analysis Techniques:
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks using STRING and Cytoscape.
Pathway enrichment and clustering with ClueGO and MCODE.
Molecular docking with SwissDock and AutoDock Vina.

Methodology
Protein & Ligand Preparation:
Structural cleaning and optimization of TLR4 using PyMOL.
Conversion of Resiquimod to compatible formats using OpenBabel.
Network and Pathway Analysis:
STRING and Cytoscape to identify critical immune pathways.
ClueGO and MCODE to highlight enriched pathways and key protein clusters.
Molecular Docking:
Simulation of TLR4-Resiquimod interactions using SwissDock and AutoDock Vina.
Evaluation of binding affinity and interaction mechanisms.

Key Findings
Strong binding interactions between TLR4 and Resiquimod indicate potential therapeutic efficacy.
Enriched pathways suggest TLR4's pivotal role in immune modulation during Monkeypox infections.
Identified clusters reveal additional potential drug targets for broader therapeutic strategies.

This study underscores the utility of computational tools in accelerating drug discovery for emerging infectious diseases. The findings serve as a foundation for experimental validation and future research into targeted therapies for Monkeypox and similar diseases.
